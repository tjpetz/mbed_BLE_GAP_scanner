# mbed_BLE_GAP_scanner

[![CI](https://github.com/tjpetz/mbed_BLE_GAP_scanner/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tjpetz/mbed_BLE_GAP_scanner/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This example works in pair with mbed_BLE_GAP_advertiser.  It demonstrates advertising and scanning
BLE using the LE_CODED PHY which will give greater range than the 1M or 2M PHYs.

This example is based on the mbed OS example for the GAP Advertising and Scanning.
